# by pts@fazekas.hu at Mon Nov 15 14:18:22 CET 2010
#
# This script has been tested on Ubuntu Lucid, but it should work on earlier
# Ubuntu versions as well.
#
# Invocation instructions for for Ubuntu users:
#
# 1. Press Alt-<F2>.
#
# 2. In the window appearing, type (or copy-paste) the following, and press
#    <Enter>.
#
#      bash -c 'wget -O- goo.gl/k9imm | bash'
#
#    Please note that the ``O'' between the dashes is a capital O. All other
#    characters are lowercase.
#
# 3. Wait for a window with a yellow background to appear.
#
# 4. Wait a few seconds untile TeamViewer is downloaded and started.
#
# 5. In the ``TeamViewer'' window appearing, find the 9-digit ID and 4-digit
#    Password fields (with blue background), and tell them to me.
#
# ----
#
# Longer invocation:
#
#   wget -O- http://pts-mini-gpl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pts-teamviewer-quicklinux/pts-teamviewer-quicklinux.sh | sh
