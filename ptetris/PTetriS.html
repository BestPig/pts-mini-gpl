appears, then probably your web browser doesn't support Java JDK1.1 or there
is a configuartion problem in your browser.

<P>PTetriS is a Java implementation of a minimalistic Tetris game,
without <I>any</I> features. PTetriS resembles the original Tetris as much
as possible: rotation order etc. match the original exactly. To start
playing
a new game, just click on the window above, and use the keys <TT>D</TT>,
<TT>F</TT>, <TT>G</TT> and <TT>R</TT>.
