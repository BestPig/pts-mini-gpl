* load ~/.joe_state at startup (?)
* print to last column (column 80) of the terminal (if available)
        int w = t->co - x - 1;  /* Don't worry about last column */
* add hide-first-character-of-line support, for visual merge + syntax highlight
* add *w <Tab> completion to the `bufed' prompt
* add list selection after <Tab> completion to all commands
* add better config file preprocessing (preprocess_rc_line)
* project: open files by pressing enter on a file list (based on error window)
* allow backslash escape in buffer name matching (simple_cmplt)
* make `bufed' show unnamed windows
* make the `explode' command add a window for each buffer (if doesn't exist)
* make `joe -orphan' default when loading: show only the first loaded file;
  also add some statistics on all files
  (File ... not changed is printed only if `joe -orphan' upon Ctrl-<K> <Q>)
  (long-term `joe -orphan' is a bad idea, because we lose cursor position)
* use buffer menu: dobuf() in ufile.c
* unify get_buffer_in_window() with replace_b_in_bw(), remember
  references external to ufile.c
* understand new-macros exmacro(bw->o.mnew,1); and exmacro(bw->o.mold,1);
* fix how Ctrl-<K> <Q> // Ctrl-<C> remove a buffer: it should load another,
  yet offscreen buffer into the current window. If all buffers are onscreen,
  unify with next or previous window, not touching other windows.
  (the notion of window groups should be understood for this)
* fix Ctrl-<K> <1>: 1st magnify current window; 2nd: restore window layout
  before 1st (this is hard, we have to remember window layout) 
* fix how Ctrl-<K> <1> and others create duplicate window with same buffer
* understand on duplicate window with the same buffer, 2nd is never cycled on
  unbufu?
* get rid of the grep buffer with Ctrl-<K> <Q> (so it won't appear again
  after Ctrk-<K> <N>); now it becomes orphaned(?)
* add search/find by highlight color
* add option not to highlight file if has a line >100000 chars at load time
* optimize with P pbak and brc() instead of bgetc()
* (long term) visual diff/merge, no automatic highlight (eptson Ctrl-<K> <0>)
* restore proper o->charmap (not only UTF-8) after leaving hex mode
* generalize `.joe-p37' to '-DDOTJOEDIR=".joe-p37"'
* automatically export markb...markk to X11 selection (both) with pts-xclip
* automatically import X11 selection with Ctrk-<K> <C> if there is no block
  (no way to paste without auto-indent, xterm doesn't seem to have support
  built in)
* invert the full terminal row if the \n at EOL is selected (this won't show
  trailing spaces)
* analyze some segfaults
* don't create new bw for `Error opening file', see use_berror in
  replace_b_in_bw.
* Ctrl-<K> <1> should show the buffer in the same order as Ctrl-<K> <N>
  (currently it shows the current buffer at the top, and the others in that
  order -- or somewhat more complicated, depending on how many windows were
  visible when we opened the file?)
* uduptw (`dupw') should redraw the new window (just as after Ctrl-<K> <1>
  twice)
* utag() should jump to the keyword being searched for inside the line
* make utag() not clear the block

# DONE: changed backspace to remove only one character if not in smart
  backspace mode.
# DONE: added flag file ~/.joe-p37/only.rc to skip system-level configuration
# DONE: added ~/.joe-p37/termcap by default (for proper alt-g xterm support)
# DONE: added config file preprocessing (preprocess_rc_line)
# DONE: added history-search-forward commands fwrdhist and bkwdhist
# DONE: added memory corruption detection to va.c and va.h
# DONE: fixed memory corruption (vaadd(npbuf, ...) -> npbuf = vaad(npbuf, ...))
  in termcap.c
# DONE: fixed find_expr_end to swallow comma after a `...'
# DONE: added \vvv to show version number in help
# DONE: made Ctrl-<T> display the menu, as previously
# DONE: added `saveother' command which keeps the buffer filename intact
# DONE: added proper <Tab> support: indent if inside selection, otherwise
  insert \t
# DONE: changed window drawing code not to update the selection marks in a
  grep--error window when scrolled
# DONE: changed Ctrl-<K> <N> just to cycle if there are more windows
# DONE: added comforable error navigation with grep, and bord current error
  line highlighting in the error window
# DONE: added $ to signify end of string in completions (simple_cmplt)
# DONE: changed Ctrl-<K> <N> to display only offscreen buffers
# DONE: fixed immediate status line update on resize, even without keepup
# DONE: fixed most of replace_b_in_bw in ufile.c (doedit1, ubufed, doscratch,
  unbufu, upbufu, ujump) to reuse existing windows and buffer positions
# DONE: added Ctrl-<]> to jump to tag/error under cursor
# DONE: fixed uarg (universal argument) for Alt-<1> etc.
# DONE: combined multiple Ctrl-<Y> dellin command to an undo record
# DONE: made prgetc() faster by making it look back only 6 bytes instead of
  going back to BOL
# DONE: speeded up p_goto_eol in UTF-8 and crlf buffers
# DONE: fixed documentation of pfwrd() and pbkwd()
# DONE: improved documentation of brzs()
# DONE: made utaghere() and tag search error reporting more verbose
# DONE: improved documentation of utf8_decode()
# DONE: added uClibc autodetection (#ifdef __UCLIBC__) to umath.c
# DONE: fixed restoring UTF-8 mode after leaving hex mode
# DONE: improved speed of brch() in UTF-8 buffers
# DONE: extended ustat() to show the byte length of a UTF-8 character
# DONE: added loading fallback *joerc if *fancyjoerc is missing
# DONE: added X11 selection import to Ctrl-<K> <C>, using pts-xclip
# DONE: made unbufu() and upbufu() fetch the adjacent buffer with respoect
  to bw->b
# DONE: made uedit() re-enqueue the new buffer after the current one, so
  upbufu() will go back to the current buffer
# DONE: added window and BW pointer dumps to udebug_joe()
# DONE: made uedit() safer on reload by making the reloaded buffer read-only
# DONE: fixed b->count calculation in replace_b_in_bw()
# DONE: made buffer interation (Ctrl-<K> <N> and Ctrl-<K> <P>) intuitive
  * Ctrl-<K> <E> adds a new buffer (or moves existing buffer) after the
    current buffer, so Ctrl-<K> <P> after Ctrl-<K> <E> goes back to the
    original buffer
  * Commands `switch', `tag', `nxterr' and `prverr' don't change the
    buffer iteration order if the buffer is already loaded. If not loaded,
    they behave like `edit' (Ctrl-<K> <E>), see above.
# DONE: replaced get_buffer_in_window() replace_b_in_bw()
# DONE: made utag() display count if tag found more than one time
# DONE: added repeat arg for utag() to jump to subsequent definitions
# DONE: simplified implementation of pgetc() for UTF-8
